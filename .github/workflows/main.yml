    # Set this option to 'true' or 'false' to enable or disable the use of thread comments as feedback. Set this to 'update' to update an existing comment if one exists; the value 'true' will always delete an old comment and post a new one if necessary. Defaults to false.
    thread-comments: # optional, default is false
    # Set this option to true or false to enable or disable the use of a thread comment that basically says 'Looks Good To Me' (when all checks pass). Defaults to true. See `thread-comments` option for further details.
    no-lgtm: # optional, default is true
    # Set this option to true to append content as part of workflow's job summary. Defaults to false.
See implementation details in GitHub's documentation about [Adding a job summary](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary). This option is independent of the `thread-comments` option, rather this option uses the same content that the `thread-comments` option would use.

    step-summary: # optional
    # Set this option to false to disable the use of file annotations as feedback. Defaults to true.
    file-annotations: # optional, default is true
    # The style rules to use (defaults to 'llvm'). Set this to 'file' to have clang-format use the closest relative .clang-format file.

    style: # optional, default is llvm
    # The file extensions to run the action against. This comma-separated string defaults to 'c,h,C,H,cpp,hpp,cc,hh,c++,h++,cxx,hxx'.

    extensions: # optional, default is c,h,C,H,cpp,hpp,cc,hh,c++,h++,cxx,hxx
    # A string of regex-like patterns specifying what checks clang-tidy will use. This defaults to 'boost-*,bugprone-*,performance-*,readability-*,portability-*,modernize-*,clang-analyzer-*,cppcoreguidelines-*'. See also clang-tidy docs for more info.

    tidy-checks: # optional, default is boost-*,bugprone-*,performance-*,readability-*,portability-*,modernize-*,clang-analyzer-*,cppcoreguidelines-*
    # The relative path to the repository root directory. The default value '.' is relative to the runner's GITHUB_WORKSPACE environment variable.

    repo-root: # optional, default is .
    # The desired version of the clang tools to use. Accepted options are strings which can be 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 or 7. Defaults to 12.
    version: # optional, default is 12
    # A hidden option to control the action's log verbosity. This is the `logging` level (defaults to DEBUG).
    verbosity: # optional, default is 10
    # Set this option to 'true' to only analyze changes in the event's diff. Defaults to 'false'.
    lines-changed-only: # optional
    # Set this option to 'false' to analyze any source files in the repo. Defaults to 'true'.
    files-changed-only: # optional, default is true
    # Set this option with string of path(s) to ignore.
- In the case of multiple paths, you can use a pipe character ('|')
  to separate the multiple paths. Multiple lines are forbidden as input to this option.
- This can also have files, but the file's relative path has to be specified
  as well.
- There is no need to use './' for each entry; a blank string ('') represents
  the repo-root path (specified by the `repo-root` input option).
- Path(s) containing a space should be inside single quotes. - Submodules are automatically ignored. - Prefix a path with a bang (`!`) to make it explicitly not ignored - order of
  multiple paths does take precedence. The `!` prefix can be applied to
  submodules if desired.
- Glob patterns are not supported here. All asterisk characters ('*') are literal.

    ignore: # optional, default is .github
    # The directory containing compile_commands.json file.
    database: # optional, default is 
    # A string of extra arguments passed to clang-tidy for use as compiler arguments. Multiple arguments are separated by spaces so the argument name and value should use an '=' sign instead of a space.
    extra-args: # optional, default is
